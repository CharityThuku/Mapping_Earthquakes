# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview of the Project 
- To create interactive maps using GeoJSON data. We used JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data.Then we used the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

## Results 
The result is as shown:

- The map below contains three different layers displaying three types of maps. It also includes three different data sets displaying what type of earthquake has occured. 
We also added a legend to display the ranges between the magnitudes of the earthquakes.

## Conclusion
- Creating interactive data is important because it allows you to focus on one topic while also being able to compare information or review specific parts of information.
